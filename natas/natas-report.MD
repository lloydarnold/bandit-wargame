# Natas -- Stage by stage explanation

## Level 0 -> 1
After initially logging in to natas 0, by going to address `http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org` and entering natas0 for both fields, we are greeted by a page which says "You can find the password for the next level on this page". 
A quick right click -> inspect element reveals the password as an HTML comment.

The password for natas 1 is ` gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto `

## Level 1 -> 2
Again, we are told that the password is somewhere on the page, but right clicking has been blocked this time. No bother; we can simply hit f12 to pull up the developer pane. 
The password is stored as an HTML comment again.

The password for natas 2 is ` ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi `

## Level 2 -> 3
